# Template for projects wishing to use TinyGL

Optimized for development on Linux and Unix-like systems, but should work on Windows with some makefile changes

use `make` to make your code.

use `make update_tinygl` to update tinygl from my repository `https://github.com/gek169/tinyglplusplus.git`

use `make clean` to clean up all extraneous files.
